In order to use the scrape.py file to get multiple seasons worth of statistics, make sure to change the season_id at the top section of the code. Another useful thing to remember is to change the filename when saving the csv each time. 

You can find the cleanest and most comprehensive CSV in the csv folder under three_Untitled.csv. The rest are other csv files that I've generated.
Feel free to explore!
