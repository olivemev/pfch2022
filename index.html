• In the 2015-16 season, 8/15 teams won more than 42/82 games. 
Together, those 8 teams averaged 8.96% 3pms. 9/15 teams this season averaged a 3pm above 8%, which means one team averaged a similar amount of 3pm to the eight teams who won more than 42 games yet won less. That team was the 76ers who won 10 games in the 2015-16 season. 
Only 2 out of the 8 teams had 10% 3pm yet other teams with lesser 3pm %’s won more games. Compare the Hornets to the Raptors. 
However, most teams with a high 3pm won more than 40 games.
